Our team set out to create a survival horror experience that would push the boundaries of the genre, blending psychological terror with innovative gameplay mechanics. Each stage of the development process presented unique challenges that tested our creativity and technical skills. From conceptualizing the initial game world to refining the intricate enemy AI, we were committed to delivering an immersive and terrifying experience. The game's core mechanic of survival under extreme psychological pressure became our guiding principle. We wanted players to feel not just the physical threat of the infected, but the mental toll of constant survival. Countless iterations, late-night brainstorming sessions, and rigorous playtesting shaped the final product. Our dedication to creating a truly memorable horror experience drove us forward, even when obstacles seemed insurmountable."

This core concept drove our entire game design philosophy. We envisioned a world where physical laws could be bent and twisted at will, creating puzzles that challenged players' perception and problem-solving skills. The technical implementation was far from simple. Our development team spent months perfecting the physics engine, ensuring that gravity manipulations felt both intuitive and extraordinary. Each level became a canvas for complex gravitational interactions, requiring players to think in multiple dimensions. Prototyping was an iterative process filled with both breakthrough moments and frustrating setbacks. We continuously refined the mechanics, balancing between being challenging and enjoyable. The final game represents not just a technical achievement, but a testament to creative problem-solving in game development."
